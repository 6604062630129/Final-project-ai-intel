# Electronics Price Predictor & Image Classifier

This is a Streamlit application that provides:
- **Price Prediction** for electronic devices using a trained Random Forest model.
- **Image Classification** to classify electronic devices using a CNN model.

## Installation & Deployment

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Models Used

- **Random Forest Regressor** for price prediction.
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** for image classification.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various electronic devices with attributes such as:
- Brand (Apple, Samsung, Sony, etc.)
- Category (Smartphone, Laptop, etc.)
- Specifications (RAM, Storage, Battery, etc.)

## Future Improvements
